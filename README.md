CF-ClassNotes
=============

####This repo contains my consolidated notes and links from the Code Fellows Web Dev Bootcamp (B-26) in August 2014

After 6 days in the bootcamp, I need to consolidate and organize my notes. Basically, I need time to study and reflect.

As Brook has said about the stages of learning:

Abstract Conceptuaization -> Active Experimentation -> Concrete Experience -> Reflective Obervation

####Plan. Sketch. Iterate

####Plan

This could just be a single long page (or maybe a version of it that is like that?), but ideally there would be a more elegant interface page where I can select from various topics and presenters, plus a consolidated listing of things from the CF blog and what not.

Categories I can see using:

Subject matter: [Git, JS, HTML, CSS, iOS]
Instructor: Brook, Dexter, Ryan, Dale, John
Date: [So far, 8/2 Git Workshop, CF-B26 Days 1-6]

Links to external resources?

Make it searchable by implementing a Googles?

####Iterate

DONE - Create and branch a repo.

Create a solid HTML outline that checks out.

Start by just typing in all of the content in plain text.
